This is a skeleton for an [Aurelia](http://aurelia.io/) client using [spoonx/aurelia-auth](https://github.com/SpoonX/aurelia-auth) for authorized access to a [Strongloop](http://loopback.io/) loopback api server based on paul van bladel's [aurelia-loopback-sample](https://github.com/paulvanbladel/aurelia-loopback-sample/) and [aurelia-auth-sample](https://github.com/paulvanbladel/aurelia-auth-sample/). While being work in progress, any given release (should) work.

[loopback-component-satellizer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/loopback-component-satellizer) is used to handle third-party authorization on the server side.

Comments on [aurelia](https://gitter.im/aurelia/discuss) or [spoonx/dev gitter] (https://gitter.im/SpoonX/Dev) and push requests welcome.
..

This version uses [spoonx/aurelia-api](https://github.com/SpoonX/aurelia-api) and [spoonx/aurelia-auth](https://github.com/SpoonX/aurelia-auth) for authorized rest api access and has an admin role included.

## Installation instructions
```
git clone https://github.com/doktordirk/aurelia-auth-loopback-sample
cd aurelia-auth-loopback-sample
npm install
cd client
npm install
jspm install
```
### Configuration
#### Third-party login
Currently included is only facebook and google+, but twitter is also included in [loopback-component-satellizer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/loopback-component-satellizer)

##### Facebook
You'll need a facebook developer account (developers.facebook.com). Add a new website app (skip quick start).
You'll find your facebook app credentials in `Settings->Basic`: App ID (which is public) and App Secret (which is private, so don't upload that one on github or alike). Set the website url there to eg `http:/localhost`. In `Settings->Advanced` in `Client OAuth Settings->Valid OAuth redirect URIs` add `http:/localhost:4000`. That's the default client address in this project.

Copy `/server/component-config.local.json.bak` to `/server/component-config.local.json` and add your facebook App Secret. Loopback applies *.local.json and *.local.js setting files after the default *.json or *.js. *.local.json and *.local.js are added to .gitignore as they **should not be publicly uploaded**.

Open `/client/src/authConfig.js` and add your public facebook clientId=App ID

#### Email verification
Email verification after signup is enabled in `server/model-config.json` ->  `"user": { "options": {"emailVerificationRequired": true}}`.

Currently included is gmail as email provider. Other options like sendMail are possible using Loopback components.

##### Gmail
For loopback to send mails via gmail, you may (certainly) need to [“Allow Less Secure Apps”](https://www.google.com/settings/security/lesssecureapps) in your gmail account. You also may need to [“Allow access to your Google account”](https://accounts.google.com/DisplayUnlockCaptcha).

Copy `/server/datasources.local.json.template` to `/server/datasources.local.json` and add gmail username and password.

#### Admin role
Copy `/server/config.local.json.template` to `/server/config.local.json` and set the admins email and password.

Currently the admin has nearly unlimited permission.

### Optional:
Install loopback-component-explorer with `npm install loopback-component-explorer --save-dev` to use the loopback api explorer (recommended, free registration needed).

Use `npm install strongloop -g` for the [Strongloop](http://loopback.io/) suite (recommended).

## How to run the sample
In the root folder type:
```
npm start
```
This builds the aurelia-client and serves client and api. Open `http://localhost:3000` to sign up or use the provided user email:user@example.com / password:none

## What's in it
#### Server
```
/server
/common
```
A [loopback](https://docs.strongloop.com/display/public/LB/LoopBack) api server with a user and a customer model with ACL.
```
user hasMany customers
customer belongsTo user
```
Unauthorized users only can list the customers. Authorized users additionally can manage their own customers. See the models in common/models.
Users can signup & login with verified emails or third-party providers (facebook). After signup with email, a verification emails is send. Users can also request an email to reset their password.

A local file is used as database. Have a peek at `mydata.json` to gain some insight.

By default loopback uses session token for authorization.

#### Client
```
/client
```
An aurelia client app with authorized pages for user profile and customer management and unauthorized pages for login, signup and customer listing.

## Details
More inforemation about the loopback server and the aurelia client code are in the [./doc](./doc) folder.

## Limitations
Config settings are not used consitently.

## Plans
- JWT / Switch to Passport
- Better scripts
- Email verification per pasting token
- Email templates
